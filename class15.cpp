//Dijkstra and OSPF Algorithm:
//1. Initialize = N = { }
//2. Maintain a priority queue
//3. De-queue the vertex which has the minimum cost
//4. En-queue all adjacent path with cost
//5. Repeat until all vertices are covered
//6. Print the shortest path tree
//-- Spanning Tree = Acyclic graph that connects all vertices
//-- Minimum Spanning Tree = Spanning tree with minimum cost
//-- Graph = (V, E)
//-- V = Vertices
//-- E = Edges
